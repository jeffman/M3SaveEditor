# M3SaveEditor

This is a decompilation of an old MOTHER 3 save editor. You probably want the .exe from the [releases](https://github.com/jeffman/M3SaveEditor/releases) page.

It's a .NET WinForms application and should run on any fairly recent version of .NET. You can run it on Linux as well under Mono.
